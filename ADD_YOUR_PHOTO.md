# How to Add Your Photo to the Team Section

## Steps to Add Your Actual Photo:

1. **Prepare Your Photo:**
   - Use a professional headshot (preferably square format)
   - Recommended size: 512x512 pixels or larger
   - Format: PNG, JPG, or JPEG
   - Make sure it's a clear, professional photo of yourself

2. **Replace the Placeholder Image:**
   - Save your photo as: `prashant-dhakad.png`
   - Place it in the folder: `/home/z/my-project/public/images/`
   - This will replace the current placeholder image

3. **Alternative - Upload via File Manager:**
   - If you have access to the project files, simply upload your photo
   - Make sure it's named exactly: `prashant-dhakad.png`
   - Place it in the `public/images/` directory
